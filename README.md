# WeatherBot
Discord Bot geocodes US place names using the ArcGIS World geocoder service and returns National Wweather Service regional radar imagery and current forecast (as text) for that place.  Errors are handled for misspellings of placenames, those outside the US, and places which would redirect the forecast page to the marine forecast page.

Requires creation of a .env file containing Discord server identifiers and tokens.

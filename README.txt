WeatherBot ReadMe
Discord Bot geocodes US place names using the ArcGIS World geocoder service and returns National Weather Service 
regional radar imagery and current forecast (as text) for that place.  Errors are handled for misspellings of placenames, 
those outside the US, and places which would redirect the forecast page to the marine forecast page.

Requires creation of a .env file containing Discord server identifiers and tokens, which in turn requires  
enabling Developer features on your Discord account and authorizing the bot in your server.
